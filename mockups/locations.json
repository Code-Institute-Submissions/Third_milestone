Unfortunaly you have to deal with a lot of rocks and a lot of beginner groups which make surfing difficult when you have to fight with 10 to 20 beginners for a wave. You can use both short and longboards. This is the answer when everything else is closing-out. A long stretch of average beachbreaks offers a wide choice of peaks; usually better close to the casino or the south jetty.",

A long jetty at the entrance can cut some wind and current but it needs SW swell and E winds to be good. A long peeling righthander after the third pier inside the fjord works in big nortwest conditions, but the seas have to be at least 4 m. Best for longboards.",
