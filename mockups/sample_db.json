    "description": "Nice white beach, very good waves, unfortunaly Hendaye knows the word tide, during low the waves aren't very good, but once there is a high tide it rocks!!. Unfortunaly you have to deal with a lot of rocks and a lot of beginner groups which make surfing difficult when you have to fight with 10 to 20 beginners for a wave. You can use both short and longboards. This is the answer when everything else is closing-out. A long stretch of average beachbreaks offers a wide choice of peaks; usually better close to the casino or the south jetty."
