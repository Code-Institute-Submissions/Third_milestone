# Surfingeurope

The [surfingeurope](https://surfingeurope.herokuapp.com/) is a Data Centric Development Milestone Project build for [Code Institute's](https://www.codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Web Developer Course.

The Surfingeurope website is a surfing locations guide that allows surfers to expolore various types of spots in Europe. The site has a social aspect by allowing users to add new locations, edit current spots and rate or comment on the existing ones based on their personal experience and knowledge.

## The Brief

The project brief required to build a data-driven web application using technologies learned throughout Data Centric Development module. The core technologies for this particular project include Python and Flask framework being the logic and Html, Css, Javascript and D3js library as a structure and visualization. The CRUD operations were carried out using NoSQL MongoDB database. 

## UX

The UX process played a major role in the design of the Surfingeurope application with all of its components playing equally important role.

### Strategy and Scope

The Surfingeurope website was created for surfers to allow them to explore spots all over Europe. The website focus on user engagements by allowing users to create new locations and edit existing spots if they believe that provided data is incorrect. The users can as well rate and comment on the spots to help other fellow surfers in making their future choices. To help making that decision, each of the surfing locations has a spot characteristics which include but is not lomited to break type, bottom type, facilities and hazards which allows surfers to find one that is matching their surfing style and abilities.

Based on the above description the following user stories were identified:

- As a user A, I want to see the top rated locations.
- As a user B, I want to see list of all locations.
- As a user C, I want to filter the locations by spot name, country and rating.
- As a user D, I want to be able to search a location by name.
- As a user E, I want to be able to tailored search by selecting specific location characteristic like break type or wave direction.
- As a user F, I want to be able to search locations by a specific facility type.
- As a user G, I want to be able to exclude certain hazards from a location search.
- As a user H, I want to be able to explore location in detail.
- As a user I, I want to edit an existing location which I believe has a mistake.
- As a user J, I want to be able to create a new location.
- As a user K, I want to be able to delete a location which I believe was added by mistake.
- As a user L, I want to rate a location based on my preference.
- As a user M, I want to be able to comment on a location of my choice.
- As a user N, I want to see all my rates and comments under my personal page so I can easily access my spots.
- As a user O, I want to be able to track all the spots I created or edited under my personal page.
- As a user P, I want to see some data showing number of locations per break type and bottom type.
- As a user R, I want to see some data showing the most popular facilities for all of the locations.
- As a user S, I want to see some data showing the most common hazards for all of the locations.
