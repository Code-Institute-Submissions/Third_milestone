# Surfingeurope

The [surfingeurope](https://surfingeurope.herokuapp.com/) is a Data Centric Development Milestone Project build for [Code Institute's](https://www.codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Web Developer Course.

The Surfingeurope website is a surfing locations guide that allows surfers to expolore various types of spots in Europe. The site has a social aspect by allowing users to add new locations, edit current spots and rate or comment on the existing ones based on their personal experience and knowledge.

## The Brief

The project brief required to build a data-driven web application using technologies learned throughout Data Centric Development module. The core technologies for this particular project include Python and Flask framework being the logic and Html, Css, Javascript and D3js library as a structure and visualization. The CRUD operations were carried out using NoSQL MongoDB database. 

## UX

The UX process played a major role in the design of the Surfingeurope application with all of its components playing equally important role.

### Strategy

The Surfingeurope website is created for surfers to allow them to explore spots all over Europe and to engage with fellow surfing enthusiast. The main aim of the application is to promote travel and to share otherwise unknown locations and local knowledge between users. 

Based on the above description and the research process the following user stories were identified:

- As a user A, I want to see the top rated locations.
- As a user B, I want to see list of all locations.
- As a user C, I want to filter the locations by spot name, country and rating.
- As a user D, I want to be able to search a location by name.
- As a user E, I want to be able to tailored search by selecting specific location characteristic like break type or wave direction.
- As a user F, I want to be able to search locations by a specific facility type.
- As a user G, I want to be able to exclude certain hazards from a location search.
- As a user H, I want to be able to explore location in detail.
- As a user I, I want to edit an existing location which I believe has a mistake.
- As a user J, I want to be able to create a new location.
- As a user K, I want to be able to delete a location which I believe was added by mistake.
- As a user L, I want to rate a location based on my preference.
- As a user M, I want to be able to comment on a location of my choice.
- As a user N, I want to see all my rates and comments under my personal page so I can easily access my spots.
- As a user O, I want to be able to track all the spots I created or edited under my personal page.
- As a user P, I want to see some data showing number of locations per break type and bottom type.
- As a user R, I want to see some data showing the most popular facilities for all of the locations.
- As a user S, I want to see some data showing the most common hazards for all of the locations.

### Scope

The Surfingeurope website should focus on user engagement by allowing users to create new locations and to edit existing spots in order to correct incorrect data. The users should be able as well to rate and comment on the spots to help other fellow surfers in making their future surf travel choices. In order to help in making that decision, each of the surfing locations should have spot features including but not limited to break type, bottom type, wind direction, type of available facilities and occuring hazards. These features together with location description would allow surfers to find at least one spot that is matching their surfing style and abilities.

### Structure

Based on the strategy and scope, the website structure should have clearly organized content and should allow an intuitive interaction for the users. The website should lack any clutter and be informative as much as possible at the same time. There shouldn't be any distractions to the users and the focus should be placed on providing the surfing location features and to stimulate users to interact with the site. 

### Skeleton

The following wireframes were created to determine the visual form and arrangment of the application elements:

- <a href="mockups/Small_device.png" target="_blank">Small device.</a>
- <a href="mockups/Medium_device.png" target="_blank">Medium device.</a>
- <a href="mockups/Large_device.png" target="_blank">Large device.</a>

### Surface

Once the wireframes were in place, the following visuals were introduced:

- The base colors for the site are green and blue with its different shades and white as the main background color. These colors were selected to match with the surfing theme i.e. colors of the ocean.
- Typography is limited to three Google typefaces with "Roboto" being the default one. It's a clean and modern sans serif typeface makes the site readable on both small and large devices. The other two are "Kaushan Script" and "Oswald". The first one was used as a base for Surfingeurope logotype and occasionally on the website to give the content some vibrant feel. The later, being a reworking of the classic gothic typeface style is used to put an emphasis on text content due to its better fit to the pixel grid of a standard digital screens.
- The website logotype and its shorcut are custom made making the site more stylish and memorable.
- The website assets include photographs, either taken from stock photography or provided by users as a surfing location image. They photographs that are used to style the application were carefully selected and edited to create a consistent overall design.

## Features

The main idea behind the Surfingeurope application is to help users in finding location that suits their needs and providing them with smooth interaction with the site and engagement with other users. The following features play a major role in that process:

- Home page.
- Page with list of all locations.
- Detailed view of the selected spot.
- Locations search functionality.
- Ability to edit existing or add a new location.
- Chart visualization.
- User personal space.
